@3 = ~I'll no be played by ye any longer <CHARNAME>! You're lucky my dagger isn't with me.~
@4 = ~I be tellin' you to make way to Xzar or ye'll not have my company for much longer.~
@5 = ~Oh, what a dreadful future! To not have some bloodthirsty imbecile at our backs..~
@6 = ~Shut it cretin! If I no see a dead green wizard, a red one will have to do.~
@7 = ~Then let us make haste to some loons corpse at once <CHARNAME>. Before I have to relieve us of this cur.~
@8 = ~I see now that ye're nothing, but a lying coward <CHARNAME>. I've no need of ye and yer lot anyway!~
@9 = ~Why you've even been dragging him along in the first place is a mystery to me.~
@10 = ~Anyways.. good riddance to bad rubbish.~

// Talk on Xzar's Deathplace
@11 = ~You weren't lying after all. The madman truly be dead! A most joyous day!~
@12 = ~One lunatic less <CHARNAME> can take in <PRO_HISHER> company.~
@13 = ~Xzar wanted us to rescue you, he cared for you. How can you be so cold towards his death?~
@14 = ~Pah! In me partnership with the mad wizard I killed many.. but no kill was as tempting as the madman himself.~
@15 = ~If only my boss hadn't took a liking to him.~
@16 = ~Now let us talk about the future <CHARNAME>.~

@21 = ~Very well. Let us waste no more time and get going.~
@22 = ~Har HAR there Montaron! Let's move then, eh, chum?~
@23 = ~On second thought. I will sleep better without you in my company.~
@24 = ~Enough talk of Xzar now! Let us find some prey for me blade.~
@25 = ~Agreed. First thing, we should get one o' me tools from my old hideout quickly. It is right around here.~
@26 = ~I will not stand for this. Trusting this vile creature at our backs is madness!~
@27 = ~I must ask you to reconsider your decision or I am forced to abandon your cause.~
@28 = ~Right you are, Sir Keldorn. I was a fool not to see the obvious. You're on your own Montaron. Leave us at once.~
@29 = ~My decision is final. It might not seem wise to you Keldorn, but I ask you to trust me for now.~
@30 = ~That's too bad then old man. If you force me to choose, you loose.~
@31 = ~A fool ye are, following the advice of an old man, blinded by some order.~
@32 = ~My work is better done without yer interference anyways.~
@33 = ~You chose right <CHARNAME>. For this I will turn a blind eye to your ealier ignorance, but in the future I expect you to follow the noble and righteous path.~

@35 = ~Then shut yer trap old man and get going already.~
@36 = ~You test my patience halfman! <CHARNAME>'s word only holds my hand for so long.~
@37 = ~No <CHARNAME>. Your indecision towards him is enough to show, that only one of us strives for righteousness. You will have to go on without me.~

@44 = ~A madman ye are! May ye suffer for all eternity, prat!~
@45 = ~Have you truly gone mad <CHARNAME>? Did we bring the Zhent spy back just for your amusement? I hope you advise with me, the next time you have a similar idea.~
@46 = ~Find someone else to do yer killin' then. My work be better done alone anyway.~

// Underdark Talk
@47 = ~This be a nice place <CHARNAME>. Why not stay down here, where no daylight can reach us.~
@48 = ~Of course you say that, iblith. You wouldn't last a minute down here alone. You're nothing compared to the drow, pathetic halfman.~
@49 = ~Don't you listen to him <CHARNAME>. Nothing good can come of us being down here.~
@50 = ~Shut yer trap girl! Yer whining makes me sick.~
@51 = ~I will be grateful when we are out of here and back under the sun. You truly need to find peace and balance in your heart, if you despise the daylight so much, you'd rather stay in this place.~
@52 = ~Go find me some balance then and stop bothering me, dirtlover.~
@53 = ~I'll not stay down here a second longer than needed.~

@56 = ~A pity. There is so much potential down here.~

@58 = ~I have no equal! Your people will learn to fear me in time.~
@59 = ~Why is confidence always wasted on those small of mind..~
@60 = ~I will bring death upon that mageling soon enough. And then I will return down here.~
@61 = ~I knew you're mad, halfman, but this is a new low. Even for you. Why we still drag this scum along I can't begin to understand, <CHARNAME>.~
@62 = ~Fine by me. Just make sure there be prey around.~

@73 = ~He is a cruel man and needs to be stopped.~
@74 = ~Taking Renals side is an easy choice, as he is higher in the guild.~
@75 = ~I agree, but going against Renal is a bad idea for anyone.~
@76 = ~I have no time for your scheming, we will resolve this quickly and be done with it.~
@77 = ~Aren't ye a goodie goodie. Though ye are right to ally the more powerful side, so I'll no complain.~
@78 = ~I'll no argue that. Let us finish our work quickly, then.~
@79 = ~Right ye are. So we best not plot against Renal, at least for now.~
@80 = ~Scheming? No. Killing Mae'Var is the only way, don't ye worry 'bout it.~
